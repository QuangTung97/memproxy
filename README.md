# Golang Memcache Proxy Library

## Why this library?

This library helps to utilize memcached in a consistent and efficient way.

**Supporting features**:

* Deal with Consistency between Memcached and Database using the Lease Mechanism.
* Prevent thundering herd (a.k.a Cache Stampede).
* Efficient batching get to the underlining database, batching between lease gets
  and between retries for preventing thundering-herd.
* Memcached replication similar to MCRouter, without the need for external proxies.
* Memory-weighted load-balancing for replication.
